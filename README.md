Wikipedia Spoiler Hider
=====

Does what it says on the tin: Hides spoilers on Wikipedia.

This script looks for sections with certain key words, hides them, and provides buttons for you to click to toggle showing them.

Never get spoiled by articles on Wikipedia again! (Satisfaction not guaranteed)

I've tested it on hundreds of pages for movies, books and video games, and it's worked wonders. Don't blame me if it suddenly fails to block a particular article, though.

Thanks to Jefferson Scher for the help with organizing Wikipedia's shitty HTML.
